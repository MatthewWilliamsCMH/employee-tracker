## Usage
To use Employee Tracker, type "npm start" in the terminal from the folder where server.js resides. Users will be offered a list of actions they can take; they navigate through the list using the arrow keys on their keyboards. Hitting the enter key will select the action. For the three actions that provide current lists, the information requested will appear immediately in the terminal. For the remaing actions, users are prompted for additional information. The action requested will be completed when the additional information is provided, and a notification that the action has been completed will appear in the terminal.
